**Title:** From employee to domain admin - Intro to Active Directory attacks   
**Trainer:** Gustavo Pinto (@ArmySick)   
**Duration:** 10:00 - 13:00 (3h)   
**Description:** An introduction to attacks on Active Directory, with a step-by-step hands-on possible attack chain that leads to full domain compromise. Understand what common Active Directory setups exist in companies, what tooling attackers use to enumerate and attack AD, and how to get the most out of them. This guided workshop is mostly hands-on, with a chain of sequential exercises after small bursts of theory.   
**Requirements:** A laptop with Kali linux installed inside a Virtual Machine; Some tools pre-installed on the VM to save time during the workshop (List will be provided at a later date).   
**Capacity:** Limited to 12 persons.

**Title:** BLE 101   
**Trainer:** David Sopas (@dsopas)   
**Duration:** 10:00 - 12:30 (2.5h)   
**Description:** Join me for an introductory yet hands-on workshop diving into the world of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) security. We'll start with the fundamentals of BLE communication, including protocols, device roles and data structures. Then, we'll explore common attack surfaces and real-world vulnerabilities found in BLE-enabled devices. Finally, you'll get your hands-on with practical exercises - sniffing, analyzing and breaking BLE communications using open-source tools.   
**Requirements:** Laptop running Linux (preferred) or a Linux VM; internal or external BLE-capable adapter; bettercap and wireshark installed.   
**Capacity:** Limited to 12 persons.

**Title:** Kubernetes Security - To road less travelled   
**Trainer:** Pedro Rodrigues (@darkcookie)   
**Duration:** 10:00 - 13:00 (3h)   
**Description:** Adopting new technology is always exciting—but as has become standard in the industry, it's often the security engineers who are left to build the necessary controls after the fact. In this workshop, we'll take the road less traveled and shift security left, going beyond the traditional Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and basic CVE correlation. We'll explore how organizations can securely onboard Kubernetes clusters into their environments from the start. Together, we'll dive into securing each stage of the development lifecycle—Build, Deploy, and Runtime—while also hardening critical adjacent components like the container registry and the cluster infrastructure itself.   
**Requirements:** Basic Kubernetes Knowledge; Laptop with at least 16GB of RAM; Minikube (or Colima) installed, A "modern" CPU with at least 6 years, and 50GB of free SSD disk space.   
**Capacity:** Limited to 12 persons.   
**Form:** https://forms.gle/DirfVRBSW6gwh5c89   


**Title:** Mobile OWASP Top10 - A Dive into Pentesting Techniques   
**Trainer:** José Moreira (@zezadas)   
**Duration:** 10:00 - 12:30 (2.5h)   
**Description:** This hands-on workshop is designed to help security professionals, testers, and developers understand the most critical security risks facing Android applications today, using real-world examples and practical exercises.   
**Requirements:** Android Studio, with emulator running. Java pre-installed on the host.   
**Capacity:** Limited to 20 persons.   
**Form:** https://forms.gle/mVjunkuYWHupUmF66

**Title:** Hardware Hacking 101   
**Description:** Join us in the hardware hacking space and adventure into the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We will have both the tools and the targets for you to learn and experiment with embedded devices—how to tear them open and learn how to tap into them directly in order to bypass security controls. Techniques showcased will include how to use multimeters and serial analyzers to find and connect to UART ports, decode I2C signals, and learn about different types of devices and firmware, and how to dump and unpack them. Targets will include routers and microcontrollers of different kinds and architectures. Feel free to bring your own device to play with! Laptops with Linux and USB cables are also a must-have to get your hands dirty.   
**Organization:** João Dias (@jpdias)
