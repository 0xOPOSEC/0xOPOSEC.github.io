		 ## Time: 10:00 -> 13:00 | Limited Spots | Mandatory Form Registration ##

Please select only one training session to attend, as they will be happening concurrently. The sign-up forms will stay open until we hit the training capacity, plus a waiting list in case any spots open up.


**Title:** Hardware fault injection, MacGyver style!   
**Trainer:** Pedro Umbelino (@kripthor)   
**Duration:** 10:00 - 13:00 (3h)   
**Description:** In this session, we will introduce the attendees to hardware fault injection on a budget, MacGyver style. We will talk about fault injections in a presentation in the first part and go full hands on approach on the second part, doing EMFi and voltage glitching with hardware built from spare/cheap parts.   
**Requirements:** A laptop with a proper serial drivers installed. Hardware will be provided for the duration of the workshop. The laptop will be used to monitor live EMFi and voltage glitches, use at your own risk! If you can connect/program an arduino/esp32 you are probably good to go. Feel free to bring your hardware tools and favorite microcontrollers to glitch (if you can program it using the Arduino IDE or Platform IO, probably it is easy test).   
**Capacity:** Limited to 10 persons (5 groups of two).   
**Form:** https://bit.ly/HackDay-HardwareFaultInjection   


**Title:** WiFi - It's free real estate   
**Trainer:** Pedro Rodrigues (@darkcookie)   
**Duration:** 10:00 - 12:00 (2h)   
**Description:** Nobody asks for the Internet anymore, everyone asks for the WiFi password! Albeit erroneous, it's the truth. WiFi is now synonymous of Internet, however, how can we ensure that our communications remain secure? A de facto technology that still suffers from vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
In this workshop, we will revisit the old protocols and see how they pan out in today's infrastructure. From the clean Open Network to Enterprise Encryptions passing by captive portals, we will look at techniques to leverage these protocols in an offensive way to open the door for bad actors.   
**Requirements:** Laptop with up-to-date Kali Linux virtual machine and a USB wireless card with injection and monitoring mode capabilities. Helper: https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatible_cards.   
**Capacity:** Limited to 12 persons.   
**Form:** https://bit.ly/HackDay-WiFiSecurity   


**Title:** Surface Security   
**Trainers:** Duarte Duarte (@dduarte) and Gustavo Silva (@gsilvapt)   
**Duration:** 10:00 - 13:00 (3h)   
**Description:** Surface Security is an open source security intelligence and automation platform open sourced in 2022, backed by the InfoSec Flutter UK&I Engineering team (Blip.pt).
In this workshop, we will dive in, set Surface up, show possible configurations and their purposes, teach how to expand Surface's capabilities and how to use the existing code to make the platform work for you. Although originally built for blue-teamers, a lot of the underlying design applies to red-teamers and what we will demonstrate will be heavily focused on bug bounty automation.You can expect in the 3 hour workshop:
- A walkthrough to setup Surface
- Setup and configure scanners
- Creating your own commands to programmatically populate data in your database

**Requirements:** Laptop and comfortable with Python code, ideally Django Framework.   
**Capacity:** Limited to 12 persons.   
**Form:** https://bit.ly/HackDay-SurfaceSecurity   


**Title:** Real world attacks on Active Directory   
**Trainer:** Gustavo Pinto (@ArmySick)   
**Duration:** 10:00 - 13:00 (3h)   
**Description:** Ever wondered what this Active Directory thing is all about and why so many attackers research and abuse it to compromise organisations? Have you heard of tools like Mimikatz and Bloodhound but never got a chance to try them out or understand how they fit in an attack chain, going from zero to hero? In this entry-level workshop, you'll learn about popular tools and techniques used to attack Active Directory and Windows domains, while hands-on testing your newly found skills against a lab environment, inspired in recent and real scenarios.   
**Requirements:** No prior Active Directory or tooling knowledge required. Laptop with up-to-date Kali Linux virtual machine.   
**Capacity:** Limited to 12 persons.   
**Form:** https://bit.ly/HackDay-ActiveDirectorySecurity   


**Title:** Web Security 101   
**Trainers:** Mariana Fernandes (@kikloki)   
**Duration:** 10:00 - 12:30 (2.5h)   
**Description:** During this training session, participants will receive a comprehensive overview of web security fundamentals, including the latest attack trends. Additionally, they will learn new techniques to enhance their skills and remain up-to-date with the latest industry developments. This training is particularly beneficial for those who write code, have a security interest, or are simply curious about potential vulnerabilities within modern software stacks.    
**Requirements:** Computer with a web browser and internet.   
**Capacity:** Limited to 20 persons.   
**Form:** https://bit.ly/HackDay-WebSecurity101   


**Note:** To get all the details sorted, we will contact all trainees one week before the workshop to confirm your enrollment. If a trainee fails to confirm their attendance on time, it will be deemed invalid, and their slot will be given to the first person on the waiting list.
