# [0x4F53494E54] - The Meet

Greetings, and welcome to 2023!

We are pleased to announce that we are getting the ball rolling with our first meetup. New year, new plans, yet we remain sticklers to the same MO; remember, "more than breaking through challenges, it is all about sharing the knowledge." If the stars align, we will indeed have a fantastic year ahead.

We'll be taking off with Pedro Vieira, a community member that will be stepping up to the stage to share some of his experience and knowledge on one of the hottest and most challenging topics, OSINT. Get ready because we will finally be breaking down one of the funniest CTFs we've ever had in the community. Be sure to wait for the final write-ups and celebrate our top-ranked players (we have some surprises in store.)

Please bear in mind this is an IRL event with no streams available. Before RSVP-ing, ensure you can attend and physically show up, as good logistics depend on it.

In the meantime, you can join our Slack chat (*) to discuss all kinds of hackish stuff and, of course, interact with other members.

Hope to see you soon!

**\[Goals\]**

Learn something new, get to know other g33ks, and, the most important thing, have fun.

**\[Agenda\]**

- "OSINT - Beware. Your data is out there" (PT/EN) by Pedro Vieira (Shell5)
- "Once Upon a Time a Xmas Challenge" (PT/EN) by The Crew

**\[Challenge\]**

It's a riddle, a puzzle, a test of your mind
Solve it fast, and be kind
The prize is worth it, so give it a try
And make this Christmas, a joyous time.

We want to thank everyone for joining us at our first meet-up! It was wonderful to kick off 2023 with so many familiar and new faces, a clear sign that our community is still going strong. It's hard to believe that 0xOPOSEC is already seven years old! The journey has been incredible so far, and we couldn't be more thrilled to celebrate this fantastic milestone with you.

As part of the festivities, we have a very special guest lined up for our next gathering: none other than one of our most internationally acclaimed community members, André Baptista (@0xACB). He will be running us through some of his latest research. If you are into weird libraries' behaviors, or you like to dig into the internals of modern software validation logics, and fuzzing sparks your interest, you are definitely in for a treat. So make sure to join us and be part of the fun at our special celebration!

0xOPOSEC wouldn't be the same without your incredible support. Here's to seven more years of creating an amazing community with you! We're sure this year will be just as unique as the last.

Please bear in mind this is an IRL event, before RSVP-ing, ensure you can attend and physically show up, as good logistics depend on it.

Why do people take their cereal choices so seriously? Did you know that there are more types of coffee than just the JAVA one? More varieties have emerged on the .NET since 2016. Personally, I prefer EXPRESSo!

During our last celebration, we marked seven remarkable years of sharing knowledge. Despite facing various challenges, our continued existence is a testament to our success. We express our gratitude and pride for all the individuals who have helped build this community. Get ready, as the third event is in the works and promises to be a thrilling experience.

Undoubtedly, exploiting the features of modern applications was and is an exciting and challenging task. During this session, we are thrilled to have Guilherme Scombatti, a well-known and respected member of our community (a wizard that can create value from others' leftovers), that will once again demonstrate the power of OSINT, this time with some "fairy dust powder". Sometimes, making a significant impact within a company only requires a meticulous analysis of their everyday technology tools, protocols and exploiting user habits. By cleverly combining tricks and well-known attack methods, tremendous success can be achieved.

If you're still hesitant to join us, allow us to entice you with Miguel Freitas' presentation. Miguel is also a well-known figure in our community, and he will demonstrate how to gain access to malicious operation data, starting from a malware sample. A captivating story of modern warfare - an epic tale of hacking the hacker that you wouldn't want to miss.

Our last gathering was truly special - for the shared knowledge and the unique mix of people from different backgrounds and expertise coming together. We are thrilled to have such a dynamic community and super excited to make the next meetup even better!

Get ready to be empowered by the outstanding Duarte Duarte as he takes the stage to set you off on the mission to develop the best and most secure code using the powerful and intriguing tool Semgrep. If you are unfamiliar with it, do not fret, we've got you covered. If you've used it before, stay tuned as we'll share valuable insights on the challenges of using it on a large scale.

And if you still need more and want to take your hacking skills to the next level? Join our fearless Zezadas for a joint hacking adventure that will put a shady home device through its paces. Get ready to witness some serious ninja tricks, shell popping, and a humorous presentation (as always!).

**\[Challenge\]**

While security cameras can provide valuable protection by deterring crime and capturing evidence, there are several ways in which they can do more harm than good. Many cameras and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices are designed with weak security measures, making them vulnerable to hacking and unauthorized access.

Can you look at this URL (https://eyespy.sefod.eu/) and try to exploit potential vulnerabilities?

We hope you had time to recharge your batteries for the last stretch of the year. After a short break, we're back and psyched up to get back in the saddle! Our Hack Day was beyond amazing and has fueled our quest for knowledge even more. So get ready because we have aligned a fantastic agenda for our upcoming back-to-work gathering!

OSINT remains a hot topic, and having a couple of clever tactics up our sleeves is always handy! This is why we are thrilled to introduce Miguel Santareno to the stage. He will tell us about his experiences pursuing malicious actors while sharing his precious tips and tricks.

Hold on to your hats because there's more. Remember the epic summer challenge we embarked on? Get ready for an action-packed session where we'll go through every challenge together. We've already got a few master solvers, but nothing beats the exhilaration of cracking it yourself and snatching that juicy flag. Btw, the challenge is still on if you're feeling up for it. Go ahead and give it a shot!

Please keep in mind that this is an in-person event. Before RSVPing, please ensure you can attend and physically show up, as good logistics depend on it.

The jolly season is here, and before wrapping up another awesome year, we wanted to thank you for your unwavering enthusiasm in every challenge and meetup, raising the bar, and propelling the community forward.

Renato Rodrigues (@simps0n) will guide us through the fundamental principles, mitigation strategies, and exploration techniques. By the end (hopefully), Prototype Pollution won't be an unfamiliar concept anymore.

Our second speaker needs no intro; Pedro Vilaça (@fG) is a master of reverse engineering. He'll take us on a journey of reversing the recent Flare On 2023 Challenge #12, a virtual machine that hides and obfuscates the flag operations. In his own words, a "cute challenge" to dig in and have some fun.

Just a friendly reminder: this is an in-person event. Before RSVPing, please double-check that you can attend and be there in person. Good logistics rely on it!

Meanwhile, you can hop into our Slack chat (*) to discuss all kinds of hackish stuff and connect with other members. *https://bit.ly/3XbyGQu (+)

**Update: Unfortunately, Jean-François Mousinho (@jemos) won't be able to make it to our event because of unexpected health issues. We wish him a quick recovery and look forward to the next opportunity.
