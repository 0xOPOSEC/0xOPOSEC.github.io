We are delighted to tell you that we are kicking off the first meeting of the year. No rest for the wicked, as the saying goes, so do join us in our never-ending quest to get better at what we do and don't miss the chance to delve into some serious hacking business in our first 2019 Meetup.

As usual, we ask you for some help with the logistics. Be sure to RSVP yes only when you are 100% sure you can attend. Thanks in advance.

In the meantime, you can join our Slack chat (https://oposec.herokuapp.com/) to discuss all kind of hackish stuff and, of course, interact with others members.

Hope to see you soon.

**\[Goals\]**

Learn something new, get to know other g33ks, build an information security community/group in the Porto area and, the most important thing, have fun.

**\[Agenda\]**

Who are you? (New participants small introduction)

# [0x72] - The Meet

The last meetup was all about celebrating our already 3-year-old community. We are proud of all the contributions that forged our path along the way and grateful to all members, true team players, who turned this community into a vibrant, collaborative and knowledge-sharing space.

To keep the ball rolling, the 3rd meetup of the year is just around the corner. The agenda is still in the works, so if you have something to share, step up and tell us about it.
In the meantime, don't forget to stay tuned for the latest updates.

# [0x73] - The Meet

Who says rabbits are the only ones that can throw a wicked egg hunt?

After the cold and gloomy winter, bursts of sunshine have finally come to make us smile! It is by no means time to laze around, it's time, instead, to spring into action.
When we join the forces for the 4th meetup of the year, we'll be unearthing easter eggs and debunking myths in the world of IoT. We know it's here to stay. Everywhere we look, there's a new integration or a mobile application. Not everyone is a happy bunny in the land of IoT and mobile, so it's time to dig deeper and get ready to face the upcoming challenges of this mind-boggling world.

As usual, we ask you for some help with the logistics. Be sure to RSVP yes only when you are 100% sure you can attend. Thanks in advance.

In the meantime, you can join our Slack chat (https://oposec.herokuapp.com/) to discuss all kind of hackish stuff and, of course, interact with other members.

Spread the word and join us for our next InfoSec egg hunt.
You'll be sorry if you miss this one.

Thanks to you, the last meetup was a great event. It is clear that the road ahead is not without its pitfalls along the way. It would be unwise to stand aloof of the ongoing game and not try to get more tricks under your belt.

Buckle up and get your notepads ready, the 5th meetup of the year will take you on a journey into the world of modern malware and dynamic code instrumentation.

We're sure you will not want to miss this ride!
