Happy 2018 everyone!

In the meantime, you can join our Slack chat (https://oposec.herokuapp.com/) to discuss all kind of hackish stuff and, of course, interact with others members.

Hope to see you soon.

# [0x6B] - The Meet

Winter's gone, and a warm sun finally awakens the earth. While fresh buds bloom and cute, fluffy animals sluggishly come out of their dens, we tend to forget the not so harmless fauna around us. Yes, you guessed it right! In our next gathering, we'll be targeting digital bugs and worms, in particular, one species that has been in the spotlight for quite some time - Ransomware. The easy bucks trend is here to stay, and from a business perspective, it might be the stuff that nightmares are made of.
Join us in our 21st Century worms dissection session and learn the inside and outs of the beasts. Do you have the guts to gut them?

# [0x6C] - The Meet

This year's 5th meetup is up!
Does "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart" ring a bell? If not, you're in luck. We'll be unearthing the history behind one of the most used security features around the web.
If PTH and PTT are something you like and use for your engagements, maybe you should keep tabs on the usual suspects and what they have been up to lately. Let's just say that being the administrator is not enough.
Join us, it's time to level up the game.

We are proud of what we've achieved so far thanks to you! There's nothing better than embarking on a journey that harnesses the best of the collective. This year's gatherings have been a big hit. We have covered a wide range of topics and shared and learned tons of hackish stuff we can put into action in our daily lives, or at least heard something to have a good laugh about.
If you didn't have a chance to take part in this great community have no fear, we are already cooking up some goodies for all the geeks out there.
Next time, we will be going down and dirty by exploring some tricks from the guys that don't mind to share their hand in advance. Join us in our 6th meetup of this year to listen to some real insights from the world of bug bounties and Capture the Flag (CTFs) challenges.
Stay tuned for more and be ready for another fun and joyful evening!
