# [0x38] - The Meet

Let's kick-off this new year the best way possible. Hopefully, a deserved rest was taken, and our minds are full of new ideas and topics that need to be explored. Bring something c00l or just share your thoughts on something juicy around security world. Again don't be shy and step up for short talk ;).

Just remember that Blip has a new home check the map (https://www.google.com/maps/place/Av.+de+Camilo+94,+4300-096+Porto,+Portugal/@41.1490978,-8.596897,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd2464ed37ecb421:0xb9cf98eb57de3cfb!8m2!3d41.1490978!4d-8.5947083) for the new location.

# [0x62] - The Meet 

It is no big news that to understand the world around us; it is mandatory to keep abreast of emerging technologies and reflect upon the impact they have on everyday lives.
Finding the right balance between usability and security is a tricky business. Do we really want to to use that shiny new "contactless" card? What is the trade-off? Shouldn't we be questioning why an ISP knows what's going on in our private network?

On this meetup, we invite you to join the discussion and bring your inputs to the table. There will be plenty of food for thought for everyone and hopefully some new tips and tricks to survive in this brave new world!

# [0x63] - The Meet

In the 21st Century, the currency of corporations, governments, and public institutions is data. Threats abound with the current spate of data breaches putting privacy in the spotlight. There's a lot of gray area when it comes to the ethical collection, use, and analysis of data within institutions. Fine lines separate the use from the misuse of data. Every day, controversial issues arise during the stages of the data lifecycle that may confound even reasonable people and expose organizations to risks.

It is hard to tell what the future holds. If there will be clear ethical guidelines to follow or not, but shouldn't we be informed about what is being done to our data right now? - What information is being transformed and stored? How are they handling it? Understanding how the different actors perform within the data ecosystems is crucial and the only way of staying ahead of the game.

This time, we have the honor of having the renowned internet security specialist Troy Hunt in our midst. He will be sharing with us part of his vast knowledge of the infosec world and talking about the challenges and lessons from managing the ethical data breach search service “Have I been pwned”.

Meetup update: The cherry on top!

If having the chance to meet one of the top experts in the sec world wasn't good enough, to top it off, in this meetup, we'll have two specialists!
If you don't remember, just a few weeks ago The Shadow Brokers leaked a gigabyte worth of NSA's weaponized software exploits. More than writing a new page in infosec history, thanks to this episode we have a golden opportunity to understand how state-sponsored attacks flow and identify which vulnerabilities are being targeted and explored.
Buckle up as Pedro Vilaça, an amazing wizard in the art of reverse engineering takes you on his journey of reversing and understanding the impact of some of the leaked tools.

Remember to join our Slack chat (https://oposec.herokuapp.com/) to discuss all kind of hackish stuff and, of course, interact with others members.

**\[Goals\]**

Learn something new, get to know other g33ks, build an information security community/group in the Porto area and, the most important thing, have fun.

**\[Agenda\]**

Who are you? (New participants small introduction)

- "Lessons from Billions of Breached Records" by Troy Hunt
- "Knock knock, who's there? NSA!" by fG!

**\[Venue\]**

There are only 40 to 50 seats available at this venue. We will be delighted to have you here, but unfortunately, we can't accommodate much more enthusiasts than that. For this reason, we will limit the number of attendees. Having this in mind, please make sure that you can attend before confirming your presence.

**\[Challenge\]**

Malware is hard to notice but running it is very easy. Grab the flag and shout it to @simps0n in Slack!
