# [0x696E69743234] - The Meet

Welcome to 2024!

We're thrilled to kick off the year with our first meetup. Our commitment to sharing knowledge is as strong as our morning coffee, and we're aiming for a stellar year that's truly out of this world!

We have exciting news to share. Our very special guest, Jean-Francois Mousinho (@jemos), is all set to join us on stage, and this time, it's for real! He will be sharing his expertise in chip development, shedding light on the ubiquitous presence of green boards in various domains, from silicon to security. Get ready for an insightful introduction to chip development, implementation, and vulnerabilities.

If that's not enough excitement for you, hold on tight because Gustavo Pinto (@ArmySick) will be breaking down our classic Xmas Challenges. Be on the lookout for the final write-ups, and get ready to cheer on our top-performing players (we've got a few hidden gems up our sleeves).

Please remember this is an IRL event with no streams available. Before RSVP-ing, ensure you can attend and physically show up, as good logistics depend on it.

In the meantime, you can join our Slack chat (*) to discuss all kinds of hackish stuff and, of course, interact with other members.

2024 got off to a flying start! A big thank you to everyone who attended our first meet-up of the year. Can you believe that 0xOPOSEC has been around for eight years already? Mind-boggling, to say the least. We're thrilled to celebrate this fantastic milestone with all of you!

To kick off the festivities, we have Mario Lima (@comet) making his debut on stage. He'll be guiding us through modern defenses, diving into topics like network intrusion detection systems, EDRs, and how attackers navigate through them successfully. But hold onto your hats; the fun isn't over yet! Ricardo Almeida (@vibrio) is making a comeback to share his expertise and cunning techniques for exploiting Windows features to get a cmd line with elevated privileges**.** Don't miss out on this unique opportunity!

Your support is like the secret sauce that makes 0xOPOSEC extra special. Let's keep the learning, networking, and hacking party going for many moons to come!

**\[Challenge\]**

Firewalls, packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and similar tools frequently struggle to differentiate between packets with malicious intent and those that are simply unconventional. If only a method existed to discern between these two scenarios.

Take a peek at this network dump (//pathonproject.com/network.pcap) and see if you can snag the flag. Remember, the flag format should be in the "ctf{...}" style and ping (@)simps0n with the solution.

What a blast we had at our last celebration! But you know what our core drive is -- our community spirit! For the third meetup of the year, we've lined up a great set of speakers.

We are happy to announce that we will be welcoming Bruno Caseiro and Marco Carneiro to our stage for the first time ever! In what promises to be an eye-opening session, Bruno will be shedding light on race conditions - a bug class often neglected but known to cause high-impact bugs. By the end of his talk, we hope that identifying, detecting, and preventing these bugs will become second nature. Marco, on the other hand, will dig into the low-level realm in one of the most (in)famous exploits for Nvidia Tegra X1 that gave birth to an unpatchable vulnerability for Nintendo Switch and other devices; if you wonder how such exploit work or just passionate about the beautiful complexity of modern systems, you will not what to miss this talk.

Please remember this is an IRL event with no streams available. Before you RSVP, please make sure you can physically show up and attend. Smooth logistics depend on your presence!

Spring is in full bloom, and we're thrilled to spring into action (no pun intended) with our fourth meeting of the year. The agenda is loaded with fresh and juicy topics that are sure to give your neurons a workout.

No more dilly-dallying; let's cut to the chase. This time, drumroll, please; Miguel Oliveira (@datadrug) is going to step up to the stage once more, but now in his mad scientist mode. Did you know that we can use Helium in the data recovery process? Would you like to know about the latest developments in SSD recovery? If so, this will be the perfect opportunity to keep abreast.
You are mistaken if you believe the previous talk is more than enough. Get ready to roll out the red carpet because Nuno Humberto (@nunohumberto) is joining us and bringing us a fine selection of security issues he uncovered during his wild explorations over the past few years. Prepare to learn and gain new insights and perspectives on your everyday technologies. Dig into what some inner works are and how the Devil is in the details when looking for impact.

Please remember this is an IRL event with no streams available. Before you RSVP, please make sure you can physically show up and attend. Smooth logistics depend on your presence!

Our past meetups were an absolute blast! We had a smorgasbord of topics to discuss and a diverse group of participants to share them with. We're thrilled to be part of such a vibrant community and can't wait to take our next gathering to the next level of awesomeness!

Our agenda is, as usual, packed with juicy stuff that will leave you wanting more. Get ready for a double dose of expertise as two of our rockstars spill the beans on their trade secrets once more!

This time, João Pedro Dias (@jpdias) will challenge us to tackle planned obsolescence. Far more than a posh word, this pesky issue is something we have to deal with all the time. Devices/Gadgets that stop working because the company shut down their services, ICS systems whose maintenance is a myth, and how the expenses of keeping them operational can drive you up the wall or how outdated software can be hacked to satisfy modern needs.

Pretty cool, right? However, Guilherme Scombatti (@scombatti) still has a refreshing Bug Bounty journey he wants to share with us. Get your notepads ready because you'll get exclusive access to practical and proven tips as we deep-dive into some of the technical aspects you need to find and exploit vulnerabilities on a specific scope.

If ignorance is bliss, knowledge is power, and we're sure you don't want to miss this opportunity to boost your brain cells.

Our final gathering before the summer break has arrived. Before heading to the sunny season, jam-packed with international events that will surely give our emotions a run for their money, we hope you can squeeze in one more knowledge boost.

The agenda is locked in and will, no doubt, bring a smile to your face. Brace yourselves for a double dose of wisdom and wit as we proudly present our dynamic duo of speakers: Rodrigo Lima (@Pengrey) and Diogo Lemos (@Diogo Lemos)! Joining us for the first time, they're all set to shake things up and bring some serious sparkle to the stage.

Get ready to dive into the world of Modern Malware Development with Rodrigo Lima (@Pengrey)! An unavoidable hot topic that's making waves in the digital realm. Join us as we unravel the challenges and learn the nifty tricks for gaining the upper hand, as well as the latest in malware design. Let's not skirt around the issue: it's a controversial topic. But now is the perfect time to tackle it head-on if we want to come out on top.

On top of that, stay tuned as Diogo Lemos (@Diogo Lemos) sheds light on a conundrum that's rattling modern software companies. From a real-world implementation POV, we'll delve into the world of secret scanning tools — uncovering their implementation, perks, and the nitty-gritty of managing secrets across a large organization. We'll also sprinkle in some tips and tricks on how to tweak and adjust all of this to widely used tooling.

**\[Challenge\]**

Once again, JP has stumbled upon what looks like a tantalizing leak from the mysterious CESOPOx0 group. Imagine the excitement—like discovering Gandalf’s lost spellbook or a secret blueprint to the Death Star. The secrets within could be real, but here’s the kicker: JP is holding the digital equivalent of a treasure map, and they have no clue how to read it.

Now's the time to channel your inner hacker hero, put on your best digital Indiana Jones hat, and decode the mysteries. Who knows? Maybe you'll uncover the Holy Grail of cyber secrets. Engage your curiosity, embrace the geekery, and may the force (and your hacking skills) be with you!
