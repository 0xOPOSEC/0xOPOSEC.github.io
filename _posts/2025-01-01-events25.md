# [0x76392E393939] - The Meet

Hello, 2025!

The new year is here, and we've cooked up a kickoff event that's bound to put you into exploit mode. Yes, calendars roll over, but our appetite for pushing boundaries and uncovering the unknown remains locked and loaded.

Making his grand debut in our little house of secrets, we're thrilled to welcome PlayStation hack scene veteran José Coixão (@José Coixão) to spill some serious console secrets. If consoles and hacking make your circuits buzz, you're in for a treat that's been years in the making. From PS3 to PS4 shenanigans, plus some tasty PS5 insights - this is the kind of insider intel you won't find in any manual.

Speaking of things hiding in plain sight - guess who's back? David Sopas (@dsopas) returns to the stage to shake things up with a deep dive into the murky waters of Bluetooth and BLE. Think those innocent wireless signals are just minding their own business? Think again! David's bringing a real-world case study that'll have you rethinking your privacy game.

And for those who've been losing sleep over our winter challenge - we've got your back! Our resident puzzle master, Pedro Rodrigues (@darkcookie), is ready to lift the veil by presenting the usual write-ups and walking us through the intended solutions and happy paths.

Just a friendly reminder: this is an in-person event. Before RSVPing, please double-check that you can attend and be there in person. Good logistics rely on it!

In the meantime, you can join our Slack chat (https://bit.ly/3XbyGQu) to discuss all kinds of hackish stuff and, of course, interact with other members.

This kickoff is your ticket to starting 2025 with some serious ammunition in your testing arsenal. Don't miss out on what's bound to be a wild ride into the new year!

**\[Goals\]**

Learn something new, get to know other g33ks, and, the most important thing, have fun.

**\[Agenda\]**

# [0x39F09FA5B3] - The Meet

Thanks to everyone who joined our first meetup of the year. It showcased how to bypass the limitations of solo hacking successfully. Nine years of 0xOPOSEC – who would've thought we'd make it this far without getting completely pwned?

For this anniversary bash, we've got a killer lineup. Rodrigo Lima (@Pengrey) is back! Remember his last hilarious talk on malware development? Prepare for another dose of insightful hacking. This time, he's tackling the sneaky risks of client-side data filtering, revealing the "hidden" data left in the dust—all through a real-life story straight from the trenches you won't want to miss!

But that's not all! Duarte Monteiro (@d0kt0r), an original c0r3 member, makes a grand return to our stage. He'll give us the lowdown on SIM card vulnerabilities, showing how OTA binary SMS and SIM card applets can be exploited. Mobile network geeks out there, this is your chance to level up!

Just a friendly reminder: this is an in-person event. Before RSVPing, please double-check that you can attend and be there in person. Good logistics rely on it!

In the meantime, you can join our Slack chat (https://bit.ly/3XbyGQu) to discuss all kinds of hackish stuff and, of course, interact with other members.

# [0x255044462D4E4553] - The Meet

As October rolls in, and after the perfect reboot, we're summoning another round of brain-tickling talks. From dissecting haunted PDFs to resurrecting retro games, this gathering promises a mix of thrills, chills, and fun.

Making his debut on our stage, the first to step in will be Bruno Macabeus (@Macabeus). He'll dive into the world of matching decompilation, rewriting high-level code that compiles into an identical binary of the original. For the sake of reviving classic consoles like the Game Boy Advance or Super Nintendo, he'll explore how LLMs can assist in such a techie yet creative endeavor. By accomplishing this mission, he'll not only be helping preserve gaming history but also be opening the door to new mods and discoveries.

But wait there's more in store for you, we'll be having another new face joining the lineup. Filipi Pires (@Filipi Pires) will take us deep into why attackers have such a soft spot for PDFs. A trusted, versatile format that's perfect for hiding malicious payloads. In this session, he'll break down how malware abuses PDF structures to conceal code, exfiltrate data, and maintain persistence. From decoding obfuscation tricks to uncovering hidden C2 channels, we will learn how to expose what's really hiding beneath the surface.

Just a friendly reminder, this is an in-person event. Before RSVPing, please double-check that you can attend and be there in person. Good logistics rely on it!

In the meantime, you can join our Slack chat (https://bit.ly/3XbyGQu) to discuss all kinds of hackish stuff and, of course, interact with other members.

**\[Agenda\]**

- "Retro game decompilation using AI" (PT/EN) by Bruno Macabeus (@Macabeus)   
- "Inside the PDF: Dissecting Structures and Tactics" (PT/EN) by Filipi Pires (@Filipi Pires)   

**\[Challenge\]**

The spirits of forgotten templates roam this [site](http://madlabs.pw:5000/?tmpl=halloween), some whispers hint that you can bend reality if you speak their language. Dare you try to command the shadows? Beware, what you inject may stare back at you...

The year's almost toast, and the holiday season is creeping in, but we're not coasting to the finish line just yet. Translation? We've cooked up a killer lineup to approach the end of the year with some serious firepower.

Kicking things off, one of the notorious researchers in the PlayStation scene, José Coixão (@José Coixão), makes his grand return. After his first intro, think of this as our intermezzo, that sweet spot between acts. If you've ever geeked out over console exploits or wondered how hackers cracked the PS4 and the twists behind PS5 breakthroughs, this is your golden ticket. Expect insider intel, unexpected plot twists, and a front-row seat to the console hacking scene.

But wait, there's more in the pipeline. Mário Lima (@comet) returns to the stage to walk us through his five-year odyssey navigating responsible disclosure in Portugal's public sector. Expect real-world lessons, exposed weaknesses, and a few nail-biting close calls. If you're hunting bugs or navigating disclosure minefields, this session is mandatory viewing. It's packed with battle-tested tips, clever tricks, and enough war stories to take home.

Just a friendly reminder, this is an in-person event. Before RSVPing, please double-check that you can attend and be there in person. Good logistics rely on it!

In the meantime, you can join our Slack chat (https://bit.ly/3XbyGQu) to discuss all kinds of hackish stuff and, of course, interact with other members.

Don't sleep on this one. Your end-of-year arsenal depends on it.

**\[Goals\]**

Learn something new, get to know other g33ks, and, the most important thing, have fun.

**\[Agenda\]**

- "A brief history of the PS Scenes - Intermezzo" (PT/EN) by José Coixão (@José Coixão)   
- "Hacking the Portuguese government for fun and no profit" (PT/EN) by Mario Lima (@comet)   

**\[Challenge\]**

This fast-shipped user-search app is production-ready and battle-tested. Try it out with Alice and Bob's friends, hunt for the juicy flag, and give a ping to (@)simps0n when you find it.
