# [0x36] - The Meet

The summer is ending. Hopefully, everyone is recharged and ready to dig in the security world again. A lot of new stuff happened since our last meeting: Info$3c dramas, epic exploits chains, corporate DB leakage, and so on. Pick one and maybe you got something to share with the community.

In the end, just join us for the 7th meeting. Remember to join our [Slack chat](https://oposec.herokuapp.com) to discuss the agenda and, of course, interact with other members.
PS: Although everyone enjoyed the human heat from the last meeting, this time we managed to get the usual event room at Blip (BlueWhale). So as usual enter on the door nº17 for direct room access.
